I'm a computational scientist interested in applying physical and
statistical methods to biological and social problems.

Currently I work for Kensho in Cambridge, MA.

Previously I was a research assistant in the <a
href="http://compbio.umbc.edu">Erill Lab</a> at UMBC, where I completed my
Ph.D. in 2016.  My research centered broadly on understanding how
bacterial cells compute their metabolism, and specifically on
biophysical models of transcription factor / binding site
co-evolution.
