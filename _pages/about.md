I'm a computational scientist interested in applying physical and
statistical methods to biological and social problems.

Currently I'm Director of Science at Tyche Analytics Company, a small
startup focused on modeling casualty risk through machine learning,
natural language processing and geospatial analysis.

Previously I was a research assistant in the <a
href="http://compbio.umbc.edu">Erill Lab</a> at UMBC, where I completed my
Ph.D. in 2016.  My research centered broadly on understanding how
bacterial cells compute their metabolism, and specifically on
biophysical models of transcription factor / binding site
co-evolution.
