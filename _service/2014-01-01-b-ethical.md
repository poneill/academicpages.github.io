In grad school I was thrice invited by the UMBC Biology Council of
Majors to debate various bioethical topics.  Although I was
technically undefeated (as measured by audience polling), the truth is
of course not determined by a vote.  I thank BIOCOM and all of my
opponents for the occasions to explore and defend my views.
