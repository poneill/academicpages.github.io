Transcriptional regulation is the most ubiquitous mechanism for
control of gene expression, motivating the development of quantitative
models for the kinetics and evolutionary dynamics of transcription
factors. Occupancy probabilities for transcription factor binding
sites are Fermi- Dirac distributed; while it is commonly granted that
the chemical potential of such a distribution is well-modeled by an
ideal gas approximation, it is not difficult to solve for it
numerically. We do so for 27 transcription factors in Escherichia coli
and show that in many cases the ideal gas approximation can diverge
sharply from the exact solution, leading to underestimation of site
occupancies by orders of magnitude. We conclude that researchers may
observe qualitatively different behaviors in models of transcriptional
regulation which admit approximate versus exact chemical potentials.
